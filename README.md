Benedict is a voice-operated teleprompter.

Paste your script, press the Play button. It'll recognise your speech and keep track of where you are in the script. You can flip it vertically to use with a teleprompter.

If you pause, it'll pause. You talk fast, it'll go fast. Talk slow, it'll go slow. If you deviate, t'll try to keep track and sync up again when you get back on script.
